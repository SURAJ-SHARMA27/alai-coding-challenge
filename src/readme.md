## Description
This project features a timeline component created using Tldraw. The timeline includes a dynamic horizontal line that adjusts its length based on the number of items added by the user. Each item can be added through a user-friendly dialog, allowing for a smooth interactive experience.

## Approach
I created a timeline component that features a dynamic horizontal line whose length adjusts based on the number of items added. Each time an item is added, its position is calculated, ensuring it alternates between two vertical positions. The line's width updates accordingly, reflecting the total number of items on the timeline. This setup provides a clear visual representation of the timeline's progression as users add items interactively.

## Challenges
One challenge I faced was implementing the wrap text functionality for the timeline items. As I saw the internship post late, I felt there was limited time available to implement this feature effectively. Therefore, I focused on the core functionalities of the timeline.
